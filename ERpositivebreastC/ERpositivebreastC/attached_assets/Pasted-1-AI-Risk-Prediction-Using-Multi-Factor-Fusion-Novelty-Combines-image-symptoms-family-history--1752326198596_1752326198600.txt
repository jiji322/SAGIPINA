1. AI Risk Prediction Using Multi-Factor Fusion
✨ Novelty: Combines image, symptoms, family history, and frequency data into one risk score.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Build an AI model that accepts:

Color intensity from strip image

Symptom input (e.g., pain, discharge, irregular periods)

Family cancer history form (e.g., BRCA gene mention, first-degree relative diagnosis)

Frequency of self-tests (e.g., every 3 months)
The AI combines all factors using a scoring model and returns a total composite risk level (Low, Medium, High).

📊 2. Biomarker-Specific Graphing
✨ Novelty: Shows progression of individual simulated biomarkers (HER2, ER+, Ki-67).
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Generate a Streamlit graphing section that:

Tracks color intensity of each biomarker zone (HER2, ER+, Ki-67).

Plots intensity scores across multiple test dates.

Highlights increasing risk if intensity score crosses a dynamic threshold (e.g., HER2 > 180 = red zone).

🔁 3. Self-Test Reminder and Adherence Tracker
✨ Novelty: Encourages testing every 3–6 months and tracks user commitment.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Create a reminder module that:

Stores the date of last image upload or test.

Sends a Streamlit notification (or UI reminder) if 3 months have passed.

Adds an “Adherence Score” showing how consistently the user follows testing schedule.

📱 4. Image Calibration via Color Reference Strip
✨ Novelty: Corrects for lighting conditions using a red standard dot or color patch.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Add an image pre-processing step that:

Asks users to include a known red reference dot (like a sticker).

Normalizes red channel intensity by comparing sample dots to the reference.

Adjusts output risk score based on corrected color range.

🗂️ 5. Risk Journal + PDF Report Generator
✨ Novelty: Summarizes history into a printable journal for clinics.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
After 2+ test uploads:

Auto-generate a health journal showing test date, biomarker results, symptom notes, and family history.

Export it to PDF using ReportLab or HTML to PDF converter.

💬 6. Community Integration with Barangay Health Centers
✨ Novelty: Recommends the nearest barangay clinics for low-cost checkups.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Create a “Nearest Clinic” module using a static list of clinics with their barangay names and phone numbers.

Based on user input (barangay, city), show:

Name of clinic

Services available (e.g., free mammogram, biopsy referral)

Contact information and hours

🧬 7. Genetic Risk Awareness Module (Simulated)
✨ Novelty: Educates users about genetic risk (e.g., BRCA1/2) based on input.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Add a page where users answer yes/no to:

“Has any relative been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer under 50?”

“Has any family member tested BRCA positive?”
Based on results, show “Genetic Risk: Elevated” with educational text on genetic counseling.

📶 8. Offline Mode with Local Data Caching
✨ Novelty: Use Streamlit’s local storage or HTML5 cache so app works offline.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Add offline support that:

Saves user image uploads and history using local storage

Allows offline use with minimal features (upload image → get risk only)

Syncs data to full app when reconnected

🎯 9. AI Chat-Based Diagnosis Explanation
✨ Novelty: Uses conversational AI to explain results to users in simple language.
🧪 Prompt for AI:
Add a chatbox that responds like:

“Your HER2 reading today is 170. That’s considered moderate intensity. While not alarming, it’s important to monitor regularly.”

Include links to learning content or suggest what to do next.
