Breast Cancer Risk Monitoring and Support AI Web Application
Overview
This web-based application uses AI-assisted color analysis and user health data to simulate risk scoring for ER-positive breast cancer, incorporating personalized tracking, education, and follow-up resources. It is designed to work with simulated lateral flow assay (LFA) test results and includes clinical context, multi-language support, and dynamic data visualization.

Application Features
1. User Interface and Navigation
Streamlit Framework is used to build a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile.

Sidebar Navigation Panel includes:

Home

Multi-Image Analyzer

Progress Tracker

Family History Assessment

AI Symptom Analysis

Support Chat

Health Resources

Clinical Trials

Education

Data Export

Language Selector (English, Filipino, Spanish) to accommodate diverse users.

2. Multi-Image Analyzer
Users can upload images of LFA test strips (real or simulated) with 1‚Äì3 detection zones.

The AI analyzes color intensity per dot and classifies the result as:

Low Risk

Moderate Risk

High Risk

The algorithm is calibrated based on red spectrum intensity, adjusted for environmental lighting via pre-analysis calibration (optional gray/red card).

3. Progress Tracker with Risk Graphing
Visual graph showing user‚Äôs biomarker risk scores over time:

E.g., Month 0: Moderate ‚Üí Month 3: High Risk

Graph is based on either color readings or AI symptom scores.

Encourages routine testing every 3 or 6 months.

Data is stored locally (or optionally on user‚Äôs device) and plotted using matplotlib or Plotly.

Allows filtering by biomarker type (e.g., ER+ simulations only).

4. AI Symptom Analysis
Users can input symptoms like:

Unusual lumps

Skin texture changes

Nipple discharge

Menstrual irregularities

AI assigns severity and frequency scores, then outputs a cumulative risk index (low/moderate/high).

Also suggests next actions (e.g., ‚Äúconsult a clinic,‚Äù ‚Äúself-monitor‚Äù).

5. Family History Risk Assessment
Collects key family health indicators:

First-degree relatives with breast or ovarian cancer

Age of onset

Known BRCA1/BRCA2 history

Adjusts personal risk baseline and may increase alert frequency or priority scoring.

6. Support Chat Interface
Simulated AI chatbot that offers:

Mental health check-ins

Self-exam reminders

Friendly, medically informed advice

All interactions include clear disclaimers: ‚ÄúThis is not a clinical diagnosis.‚Äù

7. Health Education Center
Dynamic educational sections on:

What is ER+ breast cancer?

What is HER2, Ki-67, PR, and ER?

How color detection simulates real testing

Risk factors and lifestyle considerations

Importance of early screening in the Philippines

Content is localized (Tagalog option) and accessible to non-experts.

8. Clinical Trials Finder
Filters and displays ongoing trials (simulated or through links to real registries like clinicaltrials.gov or PH local research).

Users can search based on biomarker type, age, or region.

Encourages patient education and future engagement in scientific studies.

9. Data Summary and Export
Presents user summary including:

Most recent test result (e.g., "High Risk at Day 90")

Symptom log entries

Family history flags

Risk timeline graph

Exportable in JSON or CSV format for record keeping or sharing with doctors (when applicable).

10. Privacy & Ethical Design
Data is stored only in session or locally unless user chooses to export.

No personal identifying data collected.

Educational disclaimers included on all risk outputs: ‚ÄúThis app does not replace medical diagnosis.‚Äù

11. Mobile and Offline Accessibility
Light asset design ensures good performance on low-end phones.

Optional offline mode using browser storage for field tests (future improvement).
